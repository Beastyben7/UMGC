        <h1>Project 1.1</h1>
        <h2>How Search Engines Work</h2>
            <p>In the endless sea of the internet, one might ask how Google 
                is able to sift through thousands of results in less than a 
                second, and deliver to the user the most relevant and popular 
                sources. Essentially, search engines like Google use things 
                called crawlers. These crawlers scour the entire internet to 
                locate and find results for specific user queries. These 
                queries are then stored on high speed servers that are waiting 
                to deliver the relevant results to users. 
            </p>
        <h2>Importance of Keywords and Descriptions in Meta Tags</h2>
            <p>One of the most essential strategies these crawlers use is to 
                use keywords and links to understand the contents within a webpage. 
                Crawlers use these keywords because it allows them to understand 
                the content quickly. Thus, using relevant terms will allow the 
                crawlers to locate relevant information for the end users as 
                fast as possible. Descriptions serve a very similar function, 
                though the description tag doesn't serve a major role in SEO, it 
                is still shown to the user within their search results. The 
                description serves an essential role to give the user a preveiw of 
                a page berfore they decide to click on it. If the description is 
                poor or non-exixtent, the user may decide to completely ignore the 
                source.  
            </p>
        <h2><a href="https://www.yourdigitalresource.com/post/google-four-elements-good-content"
            style="text-decoration: none; color: black;" target="_blank">
            4 Elements of Relevant Content Links</a></h2>
            <p>
                <h3>1. Relevancy</h3>
                <p>Relevancy is your user's ability to understand and relate 
                    to the content on the page. If a user is unable to resonate 
                    with the content of a page, they will likely back out. 
                </p>
                <h3>2. Intellectual Appeal</h3>
                <p>Users want content that bring forth new and engaging ideas. 
                    Users decide to interact with your content because they 
                    are hoping to find some form of information. 
                </p>
                <h3>3. Engaging Content</h3>
                <p>When users explore a new website, they want it to be 
                    interesting in some way. If they click on a news link, and 
                    are greeted with an HTML page of plain text, they will 
                    not be engaged, and may lose interest quickly. 
                </p>
                <h3>4. Emotional Resonance</h3>
                <p>Emotions are an essential part
                    of our communication, so communicating with emotions in 
                    our webpages builds strong connections with users. 
            </p>
        <h2>What Constitutes Good Heading Heirarchy?</h2>
            <p>Heirarchy is an essential element of any design. Heirarchy tells 
                users what the most important information is first, and 
                separates it from the less important information. Using logical 
                heirarchy in a website allows users to quickly scan through 
                a website to find what they are looking for. Heirarchy is 
                developed through the use of headings, or "h" tags, as well as 
                through order and page structure. Understanding and using good 
                heirarchy is an essential component to constructing websites 
                that are as user friendly as possible.
