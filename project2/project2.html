    <h2>RentX - Real Estate Management Platform<br>
        Benjamin Smith - 6 April, 2024
    </h2>

    <h3>Project Overview:</h3>

        <h4>Client and Topic:</h3>
        <p>This website not only connects owners with renters, but it can also manage their connection after the fact.  It works for the Real Estate owned by connecting their property to relevant tenants.  It also allows for maintenance and management of their properties.  For the tenant, it is an easy way to choose an appropriate place to live.  Additionally, the tenant may submit maintenance requests for any problems that may arise. </p>

        <h4>Development Process and Engagement:</h3>
        <p>I will make this website for myself, and I will consult both renters and owners to find out what they might be looking for in a site like this one.  Additionally, I will research by examining websites and applications with a similar intent for each part of the website.</p>

        <h4>Testing:</h3>
        <p>I will test my website in all the major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) to ensure there are not issues with the code.  I will of course also submit my projects into HTML and CSS validators.  Apart from these types of issues, I will also have numerous peers try out and review my website to make sure that everything works as they would expect.  This part is primarily to ensure there is a good user experience.</p>

        <h4>Description:</h3>
        <p>This real-estate website aims to connect tenants with rental properties.  Even apart from that initial connection, renters may choose to manage their property through the website.  Tenants may submit maintenance and other requests, message the owners, manage their payments, request payment plans, agree to terms, and perform many other functions regarding their residence.  Further, from the owner&apos;s perspective, they may be connected to local contractors to perform home maintenance on their properties.  They may also seek to boost interest in their properties to keep it occupied through various discount bundles, (like 2 months half rent) or through paying the business to boost their appearance on the platform.  Through offering these services, this business will be able to extract small fees (perhaps 0.25%) for each transaction.  This would include the monthly (or otherwise) rent payments, potential subscription fees, boost fees, and any others that might be reasonable.<br><br>

        I will personally create unique branding styles, logos, and icons within Adobe Illustrator.  For the sake of this project, I will extract apartment interiors from external real estate websites.  These will likely be the only major images I will need to use.  I can also use pictures of myself or friends as placeholders for user profile pictures.<br><br>

        In terms of updating content, the majority will be done by companies or individuals looking to increase their potential to market their properties for rent.  These types of users will be able to add their properties to the website, and they will be shown on the map.  Internal updates will continue so that improvements to the design, and additions to the website’s capabilities continue.  In real life, there would also be an app where renters and tenants can perform the same tasks.</p>

        <h4>Growth and Maintainence:</h3>
        <p>Over time, after marketing introduces the platform to the appropriate audiences, users will continue to join.  For renters, there will be little to no reason to not put their properties on the website.  As the user base becomes large enough, there may be opportunities to expand the platform to include shared renter-tenant homes split by rooms, and other out-of-the-usual agreements that some people choose to make in their housing decisions.  As stated before, there will slowly become more and more opportunities to connect renters to maintenance contractors.<br><br>
        
        As services continue to grow and become more and more complicated, it will be important to hire lawyers and professionals who can help renters develop rental agreements.  They can also develop some templates that renters can use or change as they like.  There will also need to be departments within the business that can manage different parts of the business.  Marketing, design, development, etc.  By having specialized teams, the business will be able to focus efforts effectively.  In terms of the actual website, the improvements should never stop.</p>

        <h4>Organization:</h3>
        <p>The website will be broken down into two halves: the owners and the tenants.  The experience will be slightly different for each.  There will be a homepage where new users are introduced to the platform.  From here, it will initially cater to tenants, but there will be a clear path that will allow owners to add and manage their properties.  For the tenant experience, they will be welcomed to the platform with a map of available properties.  They can click and search for different properties.  When they find a property, they would like to rent, they can hover or click it for more details.  After the user has selected a property, they may contact the owner.  If no account has been made, they will be directed to create an account.  Otherwise, they will be able to contact the owners.<br><br>

        When the user has talked with the owner, they may arrange to visit the property in real life.  All else may be done online through the app.  The user may enter their payment options and bank information.  They will be asked to agree to terms and conditions as well as fill out any further details the owner requests through the app.<br><br>
        
        Once a user is renting a property, they have tools to interact with their property such as requesting maintenance or changing payment options.  They can of course also message the owners directly within the app.<br><br>
        
        For owners, their experience will be slightly different.  They will initially be asked to provide all the details to put their property on the site.  It will require some pictures as well as some obvious details.  They will have to specify some common details about the property such as rules regarding smoking indoors or having pets.  Once all of the required details are entered, they may put their property on the website to be revealed to potential tenants.  They can add further details in the future or adjust different things regarding their properties.  They also have the option to offer promotions on their properties if they are unoccupied and in desperate need of a tenant.  The website will intelligently offer guidance if the house has remained unoccupied for an extended period.<br><br>
        
        Once their property has been occupied, the owner can interact with their tenants via messaging, and they will also be notified of any work requests the tenant submits.  In more advanced updates to the website, they would have the option to be directed directly to appropriate and nearby contractors to fix any home maintenance issues.</p>

        <h4>Security:</h3>
        <p>This website has mandatory financial components.  Owners and tenants must both connect their bank details to use the website for its intended purpose.  This calls for high-level security to protect user accounts.  Even after logging in, they will need to pass through further security measures to view or edit their banking details, or to make any transactions.  As the web designer/developer, I can implement certain intentional design decisions to protect information like login and bank details.  I can hide these numbers behind visibility buttons.</p>

        <h4>Web Hosting:</h3>
        <p>When selecting a web host, I must choose something that offers secure financial interconnectivity.  When processing payments, they must be protected from external threats.  I chose “RentX as my business name, or rentx.com as my URL.  It is currently available.</p>

        <h4>Marketing</h3>
        <p>This website will be marketed to both owners seeking to rent their properties, as well as prospective tenants looking for places to reside.  The website will use an accurate description to draw new users in.  Through appropriate keywords, we can also direct further site traffic.</p><br>

        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
            <h4>1. What applications did you use to complete the wireframes? Did you find the application simple to use or find an alternative to what was suggested?</h4>
            <p>I created the wireframes on a paper, so that I could create and experiment quickly without worrying too much about details.  I&apos;ve tried wireframing in Figma in the past, and my creativity was limited to my slow use of the software and the need for digital perfection.  Drawing on paper allows me to make more mistakes while allowing for experimentation.</p>

            <h4>2. Explain what you learned when building the flowchart diagram in the proposal?</h4>
            <p>I already expected it, but while building it, it really showed how complicated and interconnected my site will be.  Since I&apos;ll be making a similar site to Zillow but with added interactivity, there are going to be lots of strange connections.  It&apos;s not like a simple browse-select-purchase site.  Though I may not be able to fully design it during this class, the pages would change depending on who the user is, (tenant or landlord).</p>

            <h4>3. Did you use one of the listed applications to diagram the site? If not, what did you use and why?</h4>
            <p>I did not, I decided to use Figma instead since I&apos;m already familiar with the software and I like it.  Before then, I had already created a document which goes in depth into the details required on each site.  This made the further planning easier.</p>

            <h4>4. What challenges did you face in developing the main navigation for the final project? How did you resolve them?</h4>
            <p>The navigation will need to change slightly depending on a few factors.  For example, once the user has logged in, they will no longer be presented with the login/create account buttons.  Instead, they will need the “view account” and “log out” buttons.  Additionally, it was a bit challenging determining how I would nest each button.  The notification button in the nav bar is not going to navigate, but it will release a drop down of all the notifications.  The messages when clicked will also open a drop down but can then also lead to an actual messaging page.  There&apos;s also going to be links within the page that lead to some of the pages.  These pages may not reasonably appear in that main navigation bar.  I&apos;ll also need to develop some images to use for the notification and message buttons.</p>

            <h4>5. If you did not face any challenges or issues in completing the project, what do you think are some issues or challenges someone new to creating web pages might face completing a project like this?</h4>
            <p>There are many different interconnected things that create a cohesive website.  For someone like me who is not fully engulfed in web design every day, planning for all that complexity can be very difficult.  It is important to take a step back and make more intricate plans, even if those plans are not required for this class.  It can only help.</p>
