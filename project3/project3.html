        <h2>The Importance of Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>
            Surely, most have come across a website while on mobile, where the website was clearly designed for a large computer screen. These websites require you to zoom in to be able to interact with the content on the page. To fix this problem, web developers use responsive designs to allow the design of the page to change and adjust for the screen size of the user. By doing this, the user no longer needs to precisely tap the screen or zoom in. The buttons are already bigger. This promotes an improved user experience, allowing users to focus on the content of the page rather than its design.
